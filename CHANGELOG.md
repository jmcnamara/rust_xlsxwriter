## [0.85.0] - 2025-03-26

### Added

- Added support for setting a custom temp file directory when using the
  `constant_memory` feature. This can be useful if the default temp directory
  isn't accessible or if it is loaded in memory (which would negate the effect
  of `constant_memory` mode).

  See [`Workbook::set_tempdir()`].

  [`Workbook::set_tempdir()`]: https://docs.rs/rust_xlsxwriter/latest/rust_xlsxwriter/workbook/struct.Workbook.html#method.set_tempdir

### Fixed

- Fixed issue when handling Unicode escapes in strings that don't occur at
  character boundaries.

  [Issue #141].

  [Issue #141]: https://github.com/jmcnamara/rust_xlsxwriter/issues/141

### Added

- Updated `zip.rs` version to v2.5.x.


## [0.84.1] - 2025-03-17

### Added

- Added `serde` serialization support for enum values.

  Added serialization support for unit variant enum types like `enum Direction
  {Forward, Reverse, Park}` and newtype variant enum types like `enum State
  {Temperature(i16), Pressure(u32)}`.

  [Request #139].

  [Request #139]: https://github.com/jmcnamara/rust_xlsxwriter/issues/139


## [0.84.0] - 2025-02-10

### Added

- Added support for merging Formats via the [`Format::merge()`] method.

  This also enables the automatic handling of implicit formats at the
  intersection of row and column formats, see [Row and Column Formats].

  <img src="https://rustxlsxwriter.github.io/images/format_merge3.png">

- Added additional utility/helper functions:

  - [`utility::quote_sheet_name()`] - Enclose a worksheet name in single quotes
    as required by Excel.
  - [`utility::worksheet_range()`] - Convert a worksheet name and cell reference
    to an Excel "`Sheet1!A1:B1`" style range string.
  - [`utility::worksheet_range_absolute()`] - Convert a worksheet name and cell
    reference to an Excel "`Sheet1!$A$1:$B$1`" style absolute range string.

  [`utility::worksheet_range_absolute()`]: https://docs.rs/rust_xlsxwriter/latest/rust_xlsxwriter/utility/fn.worksheet_range_absolute.html


## [0.83.0] - 2025-02-04

### Added

- Added support for worksheet outline groupings.

  In Excel an outline is a group of rows or columns that can be collapsed or
  expanded to simplify hierarchical data. It is often used with the
  `SUBTOTAL()` function. For example:

  <img src="https://rustxlsxwriter.github.io/images/worksheet_group_rows2.png">

  See [Grouping and outlining data].

  [Grouping and outlining data]: https://docs.rs/rust_xlsxwriter/latest/rust_xlsxwriter/worksheet/index.html#grouping-and-outlining-data
  <br>
  <br>

- Added support for ignoring Excel worksheet cell errors.

  Excel flags a number of data errors and inconsistencies with a a small
  green triangle in the top left hand corner of the cell:

  <img
  src="https://rustxlsxwriter.github.io/images/worksheet_ignore_error1.png">

  These warnings can be useful indicators that there is an issue in the
  spreadsheet but sometimes it is preferable to turn them off. At the file level
  these errors can be ignored by using [`Worksheet::ignore_error()`] and
  [`Worksheet::ignore_error_range()`].

  [`Worksheet::ignore_error()`]: https://docs.rs/rust_xlsxwriter/latest/rust_xlsxwriter/worksheet/struct.Worksheet.html#method.ignore_error
  [`Worksheet::ignore_error_range()`]: https://docs.rs/rust_xlsxwriter/latest/rust_xlsxwriter/worksheet/struct.Worksheet.html#method.ignore_error_range
  <br>
  <br>

- Added support for worksheet background images via the [`Worksheet::insert_background_image()`] method.

  <img src="https://rustxlsxwriter.github.io/images/app_background_image.png">

  [`Worksheet::insert_background_image()`]: https://docs.rs/rust_xlsxwriter/latest/rust_xlsxwriter/worksheet/struct.Worksheet.html#method.insert_background_image



## [0.82.0] - 2025-01-29

### Added

- Added support for checkboxes via the [`Worksheet::insert_checkbox()`] method.

  Checkboxes are [a new feature added to Excel] in the last year. They are a way
  of displaying a boolean value as a checkbox in a cell. The underlying value is
  still an Excel `TRUE/FALSE` boolean value and can be used in formulas and in
  references.

  <img src="https://rustxlsxwriter.github.io/images/checkbox.png">

  [`Worksheet::insert_checkbox()`]: https://docs.rs/rust_xlsxwriter/latest/rust_xlsxwriter/worksheet/struct.Worksheet.html#method.insert_checkbox

- Added support for overriding the default handling of NaN and Infinity numbers.
  These aren't supported by Excel so they are replaced with default or custom
  string values. See:

  - [`Worksheet::set_nan_value()`]
  - [`Worksheet::set_infinity_value()`]
  - [`Worksheet::set_neg_infinity_value()`]

  [`Worksheet::set_nan_value()`]: https://docs.rs/rust_xlsxwriter/latest/rust_xlsxwriter/worksheet/struct.Worksheet.html#method.set_nan_value
  [`Worksheet::set_infinity_value()`]: https://docs.rs/rust_xlsxwriter/latest/rust_xlsxwriter/worksheet/struct.Worksheet.html#method.set_infinity_value
  [`Worksheet::set_neg_infinity_value()`]: https://docs.rs/rust_xlsxwriter/latest/rust_xlsxwriter/worksheet/struct.Worksheet.html#method.set_neg_infinity_value


- Updated `polars` dependency to 0.46 to pick up latest Polars additions for
  [`polars_excel_writer`].


## [0.81.0] - 2025-01-18

### Added

- Added the optional crate feature `rust_decimal`  to allow writing the
  [`Decimal`] type in [`Worksheet::write()`] via [`rust_decimal`]. This requires
  that the `Decimal` can be represented as a `f64` in Excel.

  [Request #127]

- Added the [`Worksheet::autofit_to_max_width()`] method to enable autofitting
  long strings with an upper limit for readability.

- Updated `polars` dependency to 0.45 to pick up latest Polars additions for
  [`polars_excel_writer`].

- Added some code changes to prepare for Rust edition 2024.


  [`Decimal`]: https://docs.rs/rust_decimal/latest/rust_decimal/struct.Decimal.html

  [`Worksheet::autofit_to_max_width()`]: https://docs.rs/rust_xlsxwriter/latest/rust_xlsxwriter/worksheet/struct.Worksheet.html#method.autofit_to_max_width


## [0.80.0] - 2024-12-07

### Fixed

- Fixed issue where unnecessary heap memory was being used to zip worksheets in
  `constant_memory` mode. This version is a recommended upgrade for anyone using
  that mode/feature.

  [Issue #120]

  [Issue #120]: https://github.com/jmcnamara/rust_xlsxwriter/issues/120

### Added

- Added the [`utility::cell_autofit_width()`] function to allow users to
  calculate a string auto-fit width so that they can implement their own
  auto-fit functionality with additional logic.

  [`utility::cell_autofit_width()`]:
      https://docs.rs/rust_xlsxwriter/latest/rust_xlsxwriter/utility/fn.cell_autofit_width.html

- Updated `polars` dependency to 0.44 to pick up latest Polars additions for
  [`polars_excel_writer`].


## [0.79.4] - 2024-11-18

### Fixed

- Fixed issue when handling PNG images with 0 DPI but with DPI units set.

  [Issue #117]

  [Issue #117]: https://github.com/jmcnamara/rust_xlsxwriter/issues/117


## [0.79.3] - 2024-11-15

### Added

- Made the `FilterData::new_string_and_criteria()` and
  `FilterData::new_number_and_criteria()` functions public to allows users to
  implement the [`IntoFilterData`] trait.

  [Request #115]

  [`IntoFilterData`]: https://docs.rs/rust_xlsxwriter/latest/rust_xlsxwriter/trait.IntoFilterData.html
  [Request #115]: https://github.com/jmcnamara/rust_xlsxwriter/issues/115


### Fixed

- Fixed maximum cell width when autofitting columns. The maximum width is now
  constrained to the Excel limit of 255 characters/1790 pixels.

  [Issue #114]

  [Issue #114]: https://github.com/jmcnamara/rust_xlsxwriter/issues/114


## [0.79.2] - 2024-11-09

### Added

- Added support for adding multiple objects (charts, images, shapes and buttons)
  of the same type in the same cell, but with unique offset values. This allows
  the user to position multiple objects using the same cell reference and
  different offset values when using functions like
  [`Worksheet::insert_chart_with_offset()`].

  [`Worksheet::insert_chart_with_offset()`]: https://docs.rs/rust_xlsxwriter/latest/rust_xlsxwriter/worksheet/struct.Worksheet.html#method.insert_chart_with_offset


## [0.79.1] - 2024-10-31

### Fixed

- Fixed issue where the precedence order of conditional formats wasn't being
  preserved and the rules were being sorted into row/column order instead of
  insertion order. This issue would only be visible with nested conditional
  formats and shouldn't affect most users.

  [Issue #113]

  [Issue #113]: https://github.com/jmcnamara/rust_xlsxwriter/issues/113



## [0.79.0] - 2024-10-04

### Added

- Added support for files larger than 4GB.

  The `rust_xlsxwriter` library uses the [zip.rs] crate to provide the zip
  container for the xlsx file that it generates. The size limit for a standard
  zip file is 4GB for the overall container or for any of the uncompressed files
  within it.  Anything greater than that requires [ZIP64] support. In practice
  this would apply to worksheets with approximately 150 million cells, or more.

  See [`Workbook::use_zip_large_file()`].

  [`Workbook::use_zip_large_file()`]: https://docs.rs/rust_xlsxwriter/latest/rust_xlsxwriter/workbook/struct.Workbook.html#method.use_zip_large_file

  [zip.rs]: https://crates.io/crates/zip
  [ZIP64]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format)#ZIP64


## [0.78.0] - 2024-10-01

### Added

- Added support for [constant memory] mode to reduce memory usage when writing
  large worksheets.

  The `constant_memory` mode works by flushing the current row of data to disk
  when the user writes to a new row of data. This limits the overhead to one row
  of data stored in memory. Once this happens it is no longer possible to write
  to a previous row since the data in the Excel file must be in row order. As
  such this imposes the limitation of having to structure your code to write in
  row by row order. The benefit is that the required memory usage is very low,
  and effectively constant, regardless of the amount of data written.

  <img src="https://rustxlsxwriter.github.io/images/performance_memory1.png">

  [constant memory]: https://docs.rs/rust_xlsxwriter/latest/rust_xlsxwriter/performance/index.html#constant-memory-mode



## [0.77.0] - 2024-09-18

### Added

- Added support for [Chartsheets].

  A Chartsheet in Excel is a specialized type of worksheet that doesn't have
  cells but instead is used to display a single chart. It supports worksheet
  display options such as headers and footers, margins, tab selection and
  print properties.

  <img src="https://rustxlsxwriter.github.io/images/chartsheet.png">

  [Chartsheets]: https://docs.rs/rust_xlsxwriter/latest/rust_xlsxwriter/worksheet/index.html#chartsheets


- Updated `polars` dependency to 0.43 to pick up latest Polars additions for
  [`polars_excel_writer`].


## [0.76.0] - 2024-09-11

### Added

  - Added support for adding Textbox shapes to worksheets. See the documentation
    for [`Shape`].

    <img src="https://rustxlsxwriter.github.io/images/app_textbox.png">


    [`Shape`]: https://docs.rs/rust_xlsxwriter/latest/rust_xlsxwriter/struct.Shape.html


## [0.75.0] - 2024-09-02

### Removed

- Removed dependency on the `regex.rs` crate for smaller binary sizes. The only
  non-optional dependency is now `zip.rs`.

  An example of the size difference is shown below for one of the sample apps:

  | `app_hello_world` | v0.74.0 |v0.75.0 |
  |-------------------|---------|--------|
  | Debug             | 9.2M    | 4.2M   |
  | Release           | 3.4M    | 1.6M   |


- Removed the `Formula::use_future_functions()` and
  `Formula::use_table_functions()` methods since there functionality is now
  handled automatically as a result of the `regex` change.


## [0.74.0] - 2024-08-24

### Added

- Add methods to format cells separately from the data writing functions.

  In Excel the data in a worksheet cell is comprised of a type, a value and a
  format. When using `rust_xlsxwriter` the type is inferred and the value and
  format are generally written at the same time using methods like
  [`Worksheet::write_with_format()`].

  However, if required you can write the data separately and then add the format
  using the new methods like [`Worksheet::set_cell_format()`],
  [`Worksheet::set_range_format()`] and
  [`Worksheet::set_range_format_with_border()`].

  <img src="https://rustxlsxwriter.github.io/images/worksheet_set_range_format_with_border.png">

  [`Worksheet::set_cell_format()`]: https://docs.rs/rust_xlsxwriter/latest/rust_xlsxwriter/worksheet/struct.Worksheet.html#method.set_cell_format
  [`Worksheet::set_range_format()`]: https://docs.rs/rust_xlsxwriter/latest/rust_xlsxwriter/worksheet/struct.Worksheet.html#method.set_range_format
  [`Worksheet::write_with_format()`]: https://docs.rs/rust_xlsxwriter/latest/rust_xlsxwriter/worksheet/struct.Worksheet.html#method.write_with_format
  [`Worksheet::set_range_format_with_border()`]: https://docs.rs/rust_xlsxwriter/latest/rust_xlsxwriter/worksheet/struct.Worksheet.html#method.set_range_format_with_border

- Replaced the `IntoColor` trait with `Into<Color>` in all APIs. This doesn't
  require a change by the end user (unless they implemented `IntoColor` for
  their own type).

- Updated `polars` dependency to 0.42.0 to pick up latest Polars additions for
  [`polars_excel_writer`].



## [0.73.0] - 2024-08-02

### Added

- Added support for setting the default worksheet row height and also hiding all
  unused rows.

  <img src="https://rustxlsxwriter.github.io/images/worksheet_hide_unused_rows.png">

  See [`Worksheet::set_default_row_height()`] and  [`Worksheet::hide_unused_rows()`].

  [`Worksheet::hide_unused_rows()`]: https://docs.rs/rust_xlsxwriter/latest/rust_xlsxwriter/worksheet/struct.Worksheet.html#method.hide_unused_rows
  [`Worksheet::set_default_row_height()`]: https://docs.rs/rust_xlsxwriter/latest/rust_xlsxwriter/worksheet/struct.Worksheet.html#method.set_default_row_height


## [0.72.0] - 2024-07-26

### Added

  - Added support for cell Notes (previously called Comments). See the
    documentation for [`Note`].

    A Note is a post-it style message that is revealed when the user mouses over
    a worksheet cell. The presence of a Note is indicated by a small red
    triangle in the upper right-hand corner of the cell.

    <img src="https://rustxlsxwriter.github.io/images/app_notes.png">

    In versions of Excel prior to Office 365 Notes were referred to as
    "Comments". The name Comment is now used for a newer style threaded comment
    and Note is used for the older non threaded version.

    [`Note`]: https://docs.rs/rust_xlsxwriter/latest/rust_xlsxwriter/struct.Note.html



## [0.71.0] - 2024-07-20

### Added

  - Added support for adding VBA Macros to `rust_xlsxwriter` using files
    extracted from Excel files.

    An Excel `xlsm` file is structurally the same as an `xlsx` file except that
    it contains an additional `vbaProject.bin` binary file containing VBA
    functions and/or macros.

    Unlike other components of an xlsx/xlsm file this data isn't stored in an
    XML format. Instead the functions and macros as stored as a pre-parsed
    binary format. As such it wouldn't be feasible to programmatically define
    macros and create a `vbaProject.bin` file from scratch (at least not in the
    remaining lifespan and interest levels of the author).

    Instead, as a workaround, the Rust [`vba_extract`] utility is used to
    extract `vbaProject.bin` files from existing xlsm files which can then be
    added to `rust_xlsxwriter` files.

    See [Working with VBA Macros].

    [Working with VBA Macros]: https://docs.rs/rust_xlsxwriter/latest/rust_xlsxwriter/macros/index.html


## [0.70.0] - 2024-07-14

### Added

  - Added support for adding Excel data validations to worksheet cells.

    Data validation is a feature of Excel that allows you to restrict the data
    that a user enters in a cell and to display associated help and warning
    messages. It also allows you to restrict input to values in a dropdown list.

    See [`DataValidation`] for details.

    <img src="https://rustxlsxwriter.github.io/images/data_validation_intro1.png">


    [`DataValidation`]: https://docs.rs/rust_xlsxwriter/latest/rust_xlsxwriter/struct.DataValidation.html


## [0.69.0] - 2024-07-01

### Added

  - Added support for adjusting the layout position of chart elements: plot
    area, legend, title, and axis labels. See [`ChartLayout`].

   [`ChartLayout`]: https://docs.rs/rust_xlsxwriter/latest/rust_xlsxwriter/chart/struct.ChartLayout.html

### Fixed

  - Fixed issue where a worksheet name required quoting when used with
    `Worksheet::repeat_row()`. There was some checks to handle this but they
    weren't comprehensive enough. [Issue #95].

    [Issue #95]: https://github.com/jmcnamara/rust_xlsxwriter/issues/95


## [0.68.0] - 2024-06-18

### Added

  - Added support for urls in images. [Feature Request #91].

    [Feature Request #91]: https://github.com/jmcnamara/rust_xlsxwriter/issues/91

### Changed

  - Changed the method signatures of the [`Image`] helper methods from `&mut
    self` to `mut self` to allow method chaining. This is an API/ABI break.


## [0.67.0] - 2024-06-17

### Added

  - Updated the default `zip.rs` requirement to v2+ to pick up a fix for
    [zip-rs/zip2#100] when dealing with 64k+ internal files in an xlsx
    container. As a result of this, `rust_xlsxwriter` now has a matching `msrv`
    (Minimum Supported Rust Version) of v1.73.0.

  - Replaced the dependency on `lazy_static` with `std::cell::OnceLock`. The
    only non-optional requirements are now `zip` and `regex`. This was made
    possible by the above `msrv` update. See [Feature Request #24].

  - Added an optional dependency on the [ryu] crate to speed up writing large
    amounts of worksheet numeric data. The feature flag is `ryu`.

    This feature has a benefit when writing more than 300,000 numeric data
    cells. When writing 5,000,000 numeric cells it can be 30% faster than the
    standard feature set. See the following [performance analysis] but also
    please test it for your own scenario when enabling it since a performance
    improvement is not guaranteed in all cases.

  - Added Excel [Sensitivity Label] cookbook example and explanation.

    Sensitivity Labels are a property that can be added to an Office 365
    document to indicate that it is compliant with a company’s information
    protection policies. Sensitivity Labels have designations like
    “Confidential”, “Internal use only”, or “Public” depending on the policies
    implemented by the company. They are generally only enabled for enterprise
    versions of Office.

  - Updated all dependency versions to the latest current values.

## [0.66.0] - 2024-06-12

### Added

  - Added example of using a secondary X axis. See [Chart Secondary Axes].

### Changed

  - Changed `ChartSeries::set_y2_axis()` to `ChartSeries::set_secondary_axis()` for API consistency.

   [`ChartSeries::set_secondary_axis()`]: https://docs.rs/rust_xlsxwriter/latest/rust_xlsxwriter/chart/struct.ChartSeries.html#method.set_secondary_axis


## [0.65.0] - 2024-06-11

### Added

  - Added support for [Chart Secondary Axes] and [Combined Charts].

    [Chart Secondary Axes]: https://docs.rs/rust_xlsxwriter/latest/rust_xlsxwriter/chart/index.html#secondary-axes
    [Combined Charts]: https://docs.rs/rust_xlsxwriter/latest/rust_xlsxwriter/chart/index.html#combined-charts


## [0.64.2] - 2024-04-13

### Fixed

  - Fixed internal links in table of contents.


## [0.64.1] - 2024-03-26

### Added

  - Added the [`worksheet::set_screen_gridlines()`] method to turn on/offscreen gridlines.

  [`worksheet::set_screen_gridlines()`]: https://docs.rs/rust_xlsxwriter/latest/rust_xlsxwriter/worksheet/struct.Worksheet.html#method.set_screen_gridlines

  - Added updated docs on [Working with Workbooks] and [Working with Worksheets].

  [Working with Workbooks]: https://docs.rs/rust_xlsxwriter/latest/rust_xlsxwriter/workbook/index.html
  [Working with Worksheets]: https://docs.rs/rust_xlsxwriter/latest/rust_xlsxwriter/worksheet/index.html


## [0.64.0] - 2024-03-18

### Added

- Add support for worksheet sparklines. Sparklines are a feature of Excel 2010+
  which allows you to add small charts to worksheet cells. These are useful for
  showing data trends in a compact visual format.

  See [Working with Sparklines].

  <img src="https://rustxlsxwriter.github.io/images/sparklines1.png">

  [Working with Sparklines]: https://docs.rs/rust_xlsxwriter/latest/rust_xlsxwriter/sparkline/index.html


## [0.63.0] - 2024-02-25

### Added

- Added support for embedding images into worksheets with
  [`worksheet::embed_image()`] and [`worksheet::embed_image_with_format()`] and
  the [`Image`] struct. See the [Embedded Images] example.

  This can be useful if you are building a spreadsheet of products with a
  column of images for each product. Embedded images move with the cell so they
  can be used in worksheet tables or data ranges that will be sorted or
  filtered.

  This functionality is the equivalent of Excel's menu option to insert an image
  using the option to "Place in Cell" which is available in Excel 365 versions
  from 2023 onwards.

  [`worksheet::embed_image()`]: https://docs.rs/rust_xlsxwriter/latest/rust_xlsxwriter/worksheet/struct.Worksheet.html#method.embed_image
  [`worksheet::embed_image_with_format()`]: https://docs.rs/rust_xlsxwriter/latest/rust_xlsxwriter/worksheet/struct.Worksheet.html#method.embed_image_with_format

  [Embedded Images]: https://docs.rs/rust_xlsxwriter/latest/rust_xlsxwriter/cookbook/index.html#insert-images-embedding-an-image-in-a-cell


- Updated `polars` dependency to 0.37.2 to pick up latest Polars additions for
  [`polars_excel_writer`].


- Added [`utility::check_sheet_name()`] function to allow checking for valid
  worksheet names according to Excel's naming rules. This functionality was
  previously `pub(crate)` private.

  [Feature Request #83].

  [Feature Request #83]: https://github.com/jmcnamara/rust_xlsxwriter/issues/83

  [`utility::check_sheet_name()`]:
      https://docs.rs/rust_xlsxwriter/latest/rust_xlsxwriter/utility/fn.check_sheet_name.html

### Removed

- Removed unnecessary lifetime on [`Format`] objects used in Worksheet `write()`
  methods. This allows the the [`IntoExcelData`] trait to be defined for user
  types and have them include a default format. See [Feature Request #85].

  [Feature Request #85]: https://github.com/jmcnamara/rust_xlsxwriter/issues/85
  [`Format`]: https://docs.rs/rust_xlsxwriter/latest/rust_xlsxwriter/struct.Format.html

## [0.62.0] - 2024-01-24

### Added

- Added support for adding a worksheet [`Table`] as a serialization format. See [`SerializeFieldOptions::set_table()`].

- Added [`Worksheet::get_serialize_dimensions()`] and
  [`Worksheet::get_serialize_column_dimensions()`] methods to get dimensions
  from a serialized range.

- Updated `polars` dependency to 0.36.2 to pick up Polars `AnyData` changes for
  [`polars_excel_writer`].


[`Worksheet::get_serialize_dimensions()`]: https://docs.rs/rust_xlsxwriter/latest/rust_xlsxwriter/worksheet/struct.Worksheet.html#method.get_serialize_dimensions

[`Worksheet::get_serialize_column_dimensions()`]: https://docs.rs/rust_xlsxwriter/latest/rust_xlsxwriter/worksheet/struct.Worksheet.html#method.get_serialize_column_dimensions


[`SerializeFieldOptions::set_table()`]: https://docs.rs/rust_xlsxwriter/latest/rust_xlsxwriter/serializer/struct.SerializeFieldOptions.html#method.set_table


### Changed

- Changed APIs for [`Table`] to return `Table` instead of `&Table` to allow
  methods to be chained. This makes worksheet Table usage easier during
  serialization. Note that this is a backward incompatible change.



## [0.61.0] - 2024-01-13

### Added

- Added support for a `XlsxSerialize` derive and struct attributes to control
  the formatting and options of the Excel output during serialization. These are
  similar in intention to Serde container/field attributes.

  See [Controlling Excel output via `XlsxSerialize` and struct attributes] and
  [Working with Serde].

  [Controlling Excel output via `XlsxSerialize` and struct attributes]: https://docs.rs/rust_xlsxwriter/latest/rust_xlsxwriter/serializer/index.html#controlling-excel-output-via-xlsxserialize-and-struct-attributes


- Added `XlsxError::CustomError` as a target error for external crates/apps.

  [Feature Request #72].

  [Feature Request #72]: https://github.com/jmcnamara/rust_xlsxwriter/issues/72


## [0.60.0] - 2024-01-02

### Added

- Added support for setting Serde headers using deserialization of a target
  struct type as well as the previous method of using serialization and an
  instance of the struct type. See [Setting serialization headers].

  [Feature Request #63].

- Added additional support for serialization header and field options via
  [`CustomSerializeField`].

- Added support for writing `Result<T, E>` with [`Worksheet::write()`] when `T`
  and `E` are supported types.

  [Feature Request #64].

## [0.57.0] - 2023-12-09

### Added

- Added support for Serde serialization. This requires the `serde` feature flag
  to be enabled. See [Working with Serde].


- Added support for writing `u64` and `i64` number within Excel's limitations.
  This implies a loss of precision outside Excel's integer range of +/-
  999,999,999,999,999 (15 digits).

  [Working with Serde]: https://docs.rs/rust_xlsxwriter/latest/rust_xlsxwriter/serializer/index.html#working-with-serde

## [0.56.0] - 2023-11-27

### Added

- Changed some of the Conditional Format interfaces introduced in the previous
  release to use extended enums. This is an API change with the version released
  earlier this week but it provides a cleaner interface.

- Added support for `Option<T>` wrapped types to [`Worksheet::write()`].

  [Feature Request #59].

[Feature Request #59]: https://github.com/jmcnamara/rust_xlsxwriter/issues/59

### Added

- Added support for chart trendlines (Linear, Polynomial, Moving Average, etc.)
  via the [`ChartTrendline`] struct and methods.

- Added the [`Worksheet::set_very_hidden()`] method to hide a worksheet similar
  to the [`Worksheet::set_hidden()`] method. The difference is that the worksheet
  can only be unhidden by VBA and cannot be unhidden in the the Excel user
  interface.

- Added support for leader lines to non-Pie charts.

### Fixed

- Fixed handling of [future functions] in table formulas.

### Added

- Added `wasm` feature flag to help compilation on Wasm/Javascript targets. Also
  added mapping from a `XlsxError` to a `JsValue` error.

  See the [rust_xlsx_wasm_example] sample application that demonstrates
  accessing `rust_xlsxwriter` code from JavaScript, Node.js, Deno and Wasmtime.

- Added [`Workbook::save_to_writer()`] method to make it easier to interact with
  interfaces that implement the `<W: Write>` trait.

[`Workbook::save_to_writer()`]: https://docs.rs/rust_xlsxwriter/latest/rust_xlsxwriter/workbook/struct.Workbook.html#method.save_to_writer


## [0.46.0] - 2023-08-20

### Added

- Added `polars` feature flag to help interoperability with Polars. Currently
  it only implements `PolarsError` and `XlsxError` mapping but other
  functionality may be added in the future. These changes are added to support
  the [`polars_excel_writer`] crate.

  [`polars_excel_writer`]: https://crates.io/crates/polars_excel_writer


## [0.45.0] - 2023-08-12

### Fixed

- Fixed "multiply with overflow" issue when image locations in the worksheet
  were greater than the maximum `u32` value.

  Related to [GitHub Issue #51].

[GitHub Issue #51]: https://github.com/jmcnamara/rust_xlsxwriter/issues/51


## [0.44.0] - 2023-08-02

### Added

- Added threading into the backend worksheet writing for increased performance
  with large multi-worksheet files.


## [0.43.0] - 2023-07-27

### Added

- Added support for worksheet [`Table`] header and cell formatting via the
  [`TableColumn::set_format()`] and [`TableColumn::set_header_format()`] methods.

[`TableColumn::set_format()`]: https://docs.rs/rust_xlsxwriter/latest/rust_xlsxwriter/struct.TableColumn.html#method.set_format
[`TableColumn::set_header_format()`]: https://docs.rs/rust_xlsxwriter/latest/rust_xlsxwriter/struct.TableColumn.html#method.set_header_format


## [0.42.0] - 2023-07-11

### Changed

- Made the `chrono` feature optionally off instead of optionally on. The
  `chrono` feature must now be explicitly enabled to allow support for
  [`Chrono`] types.

- Renamed the worksheet `write_datetime()` method to the API consistent
  [`write_datetime_with_format()`] and introduced a new
  [`write_datetime()`] method that doesn't take a format. This is
  required to fix a error in the APIs that prevented an unformatted datetime
  from taking the row or column format.

  **Note**: This is a backwards incompatible change.

  See [GitHub Issue #47].


### Added

- Added a [Tutorial] and [Cookbook] section to the `doc.rs` documentation.

- Added a check, and and error result, for case-insensitive duplicate sheet
  names. Also added sheet name validation to chart series.

  See [GitHub Issue #45].

- Added cell range name handling utility functions:

  - [`column_number_to_name()`] - Convert a zero indexed column cell reference
    to a string like `"A"`.
  - [`column_name_to_number()`] - Convert a column string such as `"A"` to a
    zero indexed column reference.
  - [`row_col_to_cell()`] - Convert zero indexed row and column cell numbers to
    a `A1` style string.
  - [`row_col_to_cell_absolute()`] - Convert zero indexed row and column cell
    numbers to an absolute `$A$1` style range string.
  - [`cell_range()`] - Convert zero indexed row and col cell numbers to a
    `A1:B1` style range string.
  - [`cell_range_absolute()`] - Convert zero indexed row and col cell numbers to
    an absolute `$A$1:$B$1`

## [0.41.0] - 2023-06-20

- Added the native [`ExcelDateTime`] struct to allow handling of dates and times
  without a dependency on the [`Chrono`] library. The Chrono library is now an
  optional feature/dependency. It is included by default in this release for
  compatibility with previous versions but it will be optionally off in the next
  and subsequent versions.

  All date/time APIs support both the native `ExcelDateTime` and `Chrono` types
  via the [`IntoExcelDateTime`] trait.

  The `worksheet.write_date()` and `worksheet.write_time()` methods have been
  moved to "undocumented" since the same functionality is available via
  [`Worksheet::write_datetime()`]. This is a soft deprecation.

- Added support for the `bool` type in the generic [`Worksheet::write()`] method.

[`Table`]: https://docs.rs/rust_xlsxwriter/latest/rust_xlsxwriter/struct.Table.html
[`Worksheet::add_table()`]: https://docs.rs/rust_xlsxwriter/latest/rust_xlsxwriter/worksheet/struct.Worksheet.html#method.add_table


## [0.39.0] - 2023-05-23

### Added

- Added [`Worksheet::write_row()`], [`Worksheet::write_column()`],
  [`Worksheet::write_row_matrix()`] and [`Worksheet::write_column_matrix()`]
  methods to write arrays/iterators of data.

- Added [`Formula`] and [`Url`] types to use with generic [`Worksheet::write()`].

  [Feature Request #16].

- Make several string handling APIs more generic using `impl Into<String>`.

  [Feature Request #16].

- Renamed/refactored `XlsxColor` to [`Color`] for API consistency. The
  `XlsxColor` type alias is still available for backward compatibility.

## [0.37.0] - 2023-04-30

### Added

- Added font formatting support to chart titles, legends, axes and data labels
  via [`ChartFont`] and various `set_font()` methods.

- Made [`Worksheet::write_string()`] and [`Worksheet::write()`] more generic via
  `impl Into<String>` to allow them to handle `&str`, `&String`, `String`, and

## [0.35.0] - 2023-04-16

### Added

- Added support for Chart Series data labels including custom data labels. See
  [`ChartDataLabel`], [`Chart::series.set_data_label()`] and [`Chart::series.set_custom_data_labels()`].

## [0.34.0] - 2023-04-12

### Added

Performance improvement release.

- Added optimizations across the library. For larger files this version is 10%
  faster than previous versions.

  These optimizations were provided by Adrián Delgado, see [GitHub Issue #23].

- Added crate feature `zlib` which adds a dependency on zlib and a C compiler
  but is around 1.6x faster for larger files. With this feature enabled it is
  even faster than the native C version libxlsxwriter by around 1.4x for large
  files.

  See also the [Performance] section of the user guide.

## [0.33.0] - 2023-04-10

### Added

- Added support for formatting and setting chart points via the [`ChartPoint`]
  struct. This is mainly useful as the way of specifying segment colors in Pie
  charts.

  See the updated [Pie Chart] example in the user guide.

- Added support for formatting and setting chart markers via the [`ChartMarker`]
  struct.

- Added [`Chart::set_rotation()`] and [`Chart::set_hole_size()`] methods for Pie and Doughnut charts.

- Added support to differentiate between `Color::Default` and
  `Color::Automatic` colors for Excel elements. These are usually equivalent
  but there are some cases where the "Automatic" color, which can be set at a
  system level, is different from the Default color.

## [0.32.0] - 2023-04-03

### Added

- Added formatting for the chart title and axes via the the [`ChartFormat`]
  struct.

## [0.31.0] - 2023-04-02

### Added

- Added formatting for the chart area, plot area, and legend via the the
  [`ChartFormat`] struct.


## [0.30.0] - 2023-03-31

### Added

- Added chart formatting for Lines, Borders, Solid fills and Pattern fills via
  the [`ChartFormat`] struct. This is currently only available for chart series
  but it will be extended in the next release for most other chart elements.

  See also the [Chart Fill Pattern] example in the user guide.

- Added `IntoColor` trait to allow syntactic shortcuts for [`Color`]
  parameters in methods. So now you can set a RGB color like this
  `object.set_color("#FF7F50")` instead of the more verbose
  `object.set_color(Color::RGB(0xFF7F50))`. This addition doesn't require
  any API changes from the end user.

- Added [`Worksheet::insert_image_fit_to_cell()`] method to add an image to a
  worksheet and scale it so that it fits in a cell. This method can be useful
  when creating a product spreadsheet with a column of images for each product.

  See also the [insert_image_to_fit] example in the user guide.

- Added [`Chart::series.set_gap()`] and [`Chart::series.set_overlap()`] method to control layout
  of histogram style charts.

## [0.29.0] - 2023-03-16

### Added

- Added support for resizing and object positioning to the [`Chart`] struct.

- Added handling for `chrono` date/time types to the generic
  [`Worksheet::write()`] method.


## [0.28.0] - 2023-03-14

### Added

- Added support for positioning or hiding Chart legends. See [`ChartLegend`].

[`ChartLegend`]: https://docs.rs/rust_xlsxwriter/latest/rust_xlsxwriter/chart/struct.ChartLegend.html


## [0.27.0] - 2023-03-13

### Added

- Added support for Charts via the [`Chart`] struct and the
  [`Worksheet::insert_chart()`] method. See also the [Chart Examples] in the user
  guide.

- Added a generic [`Worksheet::write()`] method that writes string or number
  types. This will be extended in an upcoming release to provide a single
  `write()` method for all of the currently supported types.

  It also allows the user to extend [`Worksheet::write()`] to handle user defined
  types via the [`IntoExcelData`] trait. See also the [Writing Generic data]
  example in the user guide.

## [0.26.0] - 2023-02-03

  Note: this version contains a major refactoring/renaming of some of the main
  data writing functions and some of the enums and secondary structs. This will
  require code changes from all current users but will allow more consistent
  APIs in future releases. Nevertheless, I apologize for this level of change.


### Changed

- The following worksheet functions have changed names to reflect their
  frequency of usage.

  | Previous name                        | New name                                    |

  | `write_string()`                     | `write_string_with_format()`                |


- The following enums and structs have changed to a more logical naming:

  | Previous name             | New name               |
  | :------------------------ | :--------------------- |
  | `XlsxAlign`               | `FormatAlign`          |

  | `ProtectWorksheetOptions` | `ProtectionOptions`    |
  | `Properties`              | `DocProperties`        |


- The `DocProperties::set_custom_property()` method replaces several type
  specific methods with a single trait based generic method.
